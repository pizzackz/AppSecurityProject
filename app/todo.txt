Admin Account Management Flow Summary:
    Secure Interface Access:
        All routes require validation of a valid master key and session duration.

    Admin Account Creation:
        User inputs: username, email, password, confirm password.
        Validations: Check master key, session, and input data.
        JWT issued with identity (username, email), creation_stage set to send_otp.
        send_otp route validates JWT and sends OTP email; sets stage to verify_email.
        verify_email route checks OTP, JWT claims, and finalizes account creation.

    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
        OTP generated, hashed, stored in JWT; expires in 5 minutes.
        On successful OTP verification, admin account is created.

    Admin Account Deletion:
        Admin accounts can be deleted after master key validation.
        No updates allowed through the management interface, only via profile pages.

    Session Handling:
        On any check failure (master key, session expiry), the session is cleared and redirected to authentication.

    Read-Only Interface:
        The interface allows viewing admin accounts, with actions limited to creation and deletion.

    Logging and Monitoring:
        Every action is logged for security and auditing purposes.
        
    Rate Limiting:
        Rate limiting is implemented on authentication and sensitive actions to prevent brute force attacks.
    
    JWT Encryption:
        JWTs are encrypted to protect sensitive information in transit and at rest, ensuring secure handling of sensitive data like OTPs and user identity information.
    
    Flask-JWT-Extended Integration:
        Used for handling JWT creation, validation, and management, with additional encryption of sensitive data using the cryptography library.
